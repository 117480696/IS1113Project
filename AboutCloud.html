        <h2 align="center">What is Cloud Services?</h2>
        <p align="center">Cloud computing is the delivery of on-demand computing resources - everything from applications to data centres - over the internet on a pay-for-use basis. </p>
        </br>
        <h2 align="center">Types of Cloud Services</h2>
        <p align="center"><h3>1. Software as a Service (SaaS)</h3>
            Cloud-based applications - or software as a service - run on distant computers "in the cloud" that are owned and operated by others and that connect to users' computers via the internet and, usually, a web browser.
            </br>
            The benefits of SaaS: 
            </br>
                You can sign up and rapidly start using innovative business apps.
                </br>
                Apps and data are accessible from any connected computer.
                </br>
                No data is lost if your computer breaks, as data is in the cloud.
                </br>
                The service is able to dynamically scale to usage needs.
        </p>
                

        
        <p align="center"><h3>2. Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)</h3>
            Infrastructure as a service provides companies with computing resources including servers, networking, storage, and data center space on a pay-per-use basis.
        </br>
            The benefits of IaaS:
        </br>
            No need to invest in your own hardware.
         </br>
            Infrastructure scales on demand to support dynamic workloads.
         </br>
            Flexible, innovative services available on demand.
            
         </p>
         
                 <p align="center"><h3>3. Platform as a Service (PaaS)</h3>
                Platform as a service provides a cloud-based environment with everything required to support the complete lifecycle of building and delivering web-based (cloud) applications - without the cost and complexity of buying and managing the underlying hardware, software, provisioning, and hosting.
            </br>
                The benefits of PaaS: 
            </br>
                Develop applications and get to market faster.
             </br>
                Deploy new web applications to the cloud in minutes.
             </br>
                Reduce complexity with middleware as a service.
        </p>
         
         <p align="center"><h3>4. Communications as a Service (CaaS)</h3>
            Communications as a Service (CaaS) is an outsourced enterprise communications solution that can be leased from a single vendor. Such communications can include voice over IP (VoIP or Internet telephony), instant messaging (IM), collaboration and videoconference applications using fixed and mobile devices. CaaS has evolved along the same lines as Software as a Service (SaaS).
